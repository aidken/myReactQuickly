# Learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [ReactQuickly](http://reactquickly.co/)
Learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) reading [ReactQuickly](http://reactquickly.co/).

### Log
#### January 17th 2021
 - Read chapter one of the [book](https://www.manning.com/books/react-quickly)
 - Wrote the hello world script.
 - Make it a node module (`npm init- y`). [Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-node-js-module) is a nice tutorial.
 - Include npm script `local`, serve index.html locally. Run `npm run local`.

Local http server and sandbox are setup. Now ready to read on. Don't know that React provides yet. It's simply a black box to me.
